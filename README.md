# 📊 Loan Default Dashboard (250K+ Records)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing borrower data to identify key factors contributing to loan defaults using an end-to-end Business Intelligence workflow in Power BI.

The dataset containing ~250,000 loan records was initially provided in Excel and integrated into Microsoft SQL Server. Power BI Dataflows were used to centralize and manage the dataset for scalable cloud-based analytics.

Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query, followed by data modeling and creation of calculated measures using DAX functions such as CALCULATE, AVERAGEX, MEDIANX, ALLEXCEPT, and SWITCH.

An interactive dashboard was developed to monitor KPIs including Default Rate, Average Loan Amount, Income Distribution, and Credit Score-based Risk Segmentation. YOY and YTD trend analysis was also implemented to track loan performance over time.

Scheduled Refresh and Incremental Refresh were configured in Power BI Service to efficiently handle large datasets and enable automated reporting.

This dashboard helps financial institutions identify high-risk borrower segments and supports data-driven loan approval decisions.
